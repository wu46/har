\section{Introduction}
Human activity classification has wide reaching applications,
such as in providing medical assistance to disabled or elderly persons.
This project implements several machine learning algorithms to 
classify human posture and movements. The different activities being classified are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Sitting
  \item Sitting down
  \item Standing
  \item Standing up
  \item Walking
\end{itemize}

The difference between ``Sitting'' and ``Sitting down'' is that the former
is the static posture, whereas the latter is the transitional movement
from standing to sitting.

\section{Data}
\subsection{Source}
The data is made publicly available on UCI's Machine Learning Repository.
It can be accessed at: 
http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har\#dataset.

\subsection{Description}
The dataset contains the following features
\begin{itemize}
  \item Age
  \item Weight
  \item Body Mass Index
  \item Height
  \item x,y,z axis readings from 4 different accelerometers
\end{itemize}

  \caption{Frequency of each class}
  \begin{tabular}[]{|l|c|} \hline
    \bf {Class} & \bf {Frequency} \\ \hline
    Sitting & 50631 \\ \hline
    Sitting down & 11827 \\ \hline
    Standing & 47370 \\ \hline
    Standing up & 12415 \\ \hline
    Walking & 43390 \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}


\section{Features}
The features used in our models are the $12$ accelerometer readings.

\subsection{Binary classification}
The first model implemented was the GDA model. For each class,
$90\%$ of the class's data is used as positive training examples,
while $90\%$ from each of the other classes are concatenated 
to be used as negative training examples.
\subsection{Multi-class classification}
For a testing example, in order to make a prediction into 
$1$ of the $5$ classes, the posterior distribution is calculated for
each class, and the predicted label is chosen depending on the largest
posterior.

That is
\begin{equation*}
  h_\theta(x) = \argmax_y p(x|y)p(y)
\end{equation*} where $y \in \lbrace 1,2,3,4,5 \rbrace$.

\subsection{Results}
